It's super close to Westfield, the Metreon, and Yerba Buena. I came to Tropisueño for lunch as well as dinner on separate days. The restaurant has excellent service and excellent food! The decor has a very rustic feel and there's even a bar! Free chips and sauce are offered for both lunch and dinner. For lunch, Tropisueño offers fast-casual dining, where you pay at the counter for your order and seat yourself. My girlfriend, who is a huge fan of Mexican cuisine, thoroughly enjoyed the entree plate with Mole. I ordered a Mojado, which is a wet-burrito. For less than $10, it was a HUGE portion of food that I could barely finish. Needless to say, the burrito was delicious and I love the addition of sauce on top. Well worth the price. For dinner, Tropisueño offers a casual dining experience, with waiters taking your order. The restaurant was quite dark and loud for dinner though. I ordered the Huaraches &quot;tres Cochinitas&quot;, which had tortillas and 3 kinds of pork. The pork was tender and the whole dish was very filling and flavorful. I definitely recommend this place for casual dining, as the atmosphere is very clean and comfortable and the food is well-made, authentic, and well-priced.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

We enjoy their most delicious mexican dishes very tasty, the atmosphere is very lively pleasant and surely clean and refreshing. Their drink is so good, amazing unlike hotel drinks where the drink are diluted to 95% water, tasteless. We dined there throughout our stay in SF.

I also got a beef taco and a fish taco, and I really was not impressed with either of them.

I cannot I was always walking by this place. This is like a higher upscale chipotle. You walk in, look at a menu on the wall, and then you tell the cooks what you want to order. It's completely customizable. Once you order, you sit anywhere you want and you're brought chips to the table. You get your own water and salsa. I ordered the beef enchilada combo and Oh. My. God. It was so amazing! Refried beans had the perfect consistency and spice. The rice was flavorful and crumbly, just how I like it. The beef was juicy and tender. The best part, it's affordable. Come during lunch and it's $13 for a combo plate. Plenty of food. I grew up in a small town so we had a lot of Mexican restaurants to choose from and they were close. In sf, you have to hunt down a good mexican restaurant, but look no further, because tropisueño is located in yerba Buena park across from target. Definitely going back and will be inviting my family when they come visit.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

I came to this restaurant with my friends a few weeks ago to celebrate a birthday. We were seated in the bar area and were laughing and having a good time with one another. We ordered a round of drinks, and a half hour later, we ordered another round. But to our dismay we were told that we were cut off. This was after ordering ONE drink. When we asked to speak to the manager, we were told that someone in our party appeared to be drunk so it was their policy to cut us off. Mind you, this is after we had ONE drink, so we clearly were not. Furthermore, how could the actions of one person end with the decision to cut off an entire group of people? To me, this was simply a case of people being uncomfortable with a group of education, black professionals out enjoying themselves with one another. At no point were we bothering any other patrons. At no point were we belligerent. And at no point were we even asked to keep it down. And mind you, this was IN A BAR! After speaking with the manager, he told us that we could continue to have drinks, but that one person in the group couldn't. Really? After insulting us and making an irrational judgment you expect us to continue spending money in your establishment? No thank you. I will not be returning to this restaurant. And the owner clearly needs to look into its management.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

All the food was more than enough for 4 hungry ladies. They also offer free chips &amp; salsa. I loved the atmosphere along with the friendly waiting staff &amp; hosts. The service, however, was painstakingly slow. There really wasn't much excuse because we got there before the dinner service (which starts at 5:30pm). In fact, I recall a similar rate of service the first time I came here for happy hour. It just didn't make sense to me. Hence, I bumped them down a star. Regardless, we had a fun time.

This place is good but wait in line forever good? I think so. We also chose a Friday lunch to try this place so I'm sure it's a bit crazier. So you see the menu ahead of time and order when you get to the counter and then your food is delivered. If you want a margarita you have to order from the bartender. Prices seem reasonable (for the food- my margie was $10!) , and their menu is extensive. So, seating is first come, first served. This is especially annoying when people come in large groups. I actually witnessed a guy hogging a table of 12, who sat there from the time I arrived to the time I left. Please do the rest of us a favor and don't come with more than 5 people. I could have eaten my meal there instead of circling the restaurant for 10 minutes. The order- margarita, carnitas taco, and carna asada super taco. I'm pretty sure that was the right move. Do yourself a favor and check out the salsa bar- lots o' goodies in there. Everything was delicious and I think I hoovered it up in about 10 minutes.

It was Friday night, crowded, loud, but we had a 7:00 pm reservation for three. Two of us walked in and we were seated immediately. Upon being seated we were immediately given menus and asked what we wanted to drink. We explained it was our first visit so we needed to look at the menu and our waiter hovered. Right as we placed our drink orders (we both got the Tropisueno and it was the right choice) the chips and 3 kinds of salsa arrive. Chips are warm and salted just like I like them, but a little too thin for dipping IMHO. All the salas were excellent, but the green salsa (tomatillo) was good and earthy and I really enjoyed it. Our friend arrives, she settles in gives her drink order to the waiter and we all really start looking at the menu. Our orders were the Chile Verde with pork cooked so tender you almost didn't have to chew it, Tampiqueno (I think my friend enjoyed it even though the server came two times trying to take it away when she was clearly not finished eating) and mine the Chile Relleno (honestly, I can be wrong but my first impression was that the sauce came from a can, and my meal was not warm, but not really cold. Also, the rice was so hard a piece of it got caught in my throat.) Depending on what was ordered, the food ranged from delicious to whatever. At the end of our meal the server put on our table a little container with lollipops when he brought our bill. In hindsight we should have grabbed them right away because after he got payment and his tip (20%, mind you) he grabbed the container with the 3 lollipops and actually dropped them on the floor as he turned away. Yeah. Whatever. I would probably go again but would hope for a different server and would definitely order something different.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

The bar staff are funny and rad guys too. This seems like a pretty good spot for happy hour drinks if you're going to be sitting at the bar.

This place was great and the service was phenomenal. All people want from a server is a personable, upbeat attitude, friendly smiles and a genuine concern for your comfort and enjoyment. This place delivered! My go-to entree at a Mexican place is usually a burrito or chili relleno; I can tell the authenticity by either of these two things. However, the burritos are only on their lunch menu. So, I went with my Plan B and simply asked the waiter what he'd suggest. Right away he started pointing out the enchiladas with cream sauce. I was sold and decided to try that with the black beans. It was amazing! Definitely had fresh ingredients, fresh sauce and homemade beans -- not something dumped from a can. I also asked for a margarita of his choosing and he brought me the house margarita...or two. This place can get pretty packed -- understandably so -- so when I went, I was shown to a long, narrow table that had others sitting at it, already. I'm from Los Angeles, now living in Reno and I have NEVER seen something like this. I asked the hostess, &quot;So, you want me to sit right THERE?&quot; pointing to the only spot that was right across from a couple that were clearly on their first date. I smiled awkwardly before sitting down and waiting to order. This was all new to me, so I almost thought that since the table was so narrow, that we'd share the chips and salsas -- thankfully, I waited and didn't make a fool out of myself by snagging up someone else's chips, even though they were, literally, right under my nose. I'd have to come back here a second time to determine the consistency of the food/service to give a 5-star, but this place will forever be on my radar when I'm back in town.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

Upon arrival we were seated at the bar. We ordered a first round of drinks to kick off the celebration, soon after we ordered food and began to have a great time laughing and participating in the self promoted lively experience of the restaurant. After 30mins, I asked to order another round of drinks for the table, at which time I was told we had been &quot; cut off.&quot; We were shocked and quite confused as to why we were cut off after ONE drink. I asked to speak with a manager, at which time I was directed to a man that had been standing by our table for the last 20 mins, which now heightened my discomfort. The manager, summoned 4 other men ( including the bartender) to also be included in this conversation that I thought was going to be between him and I- I suppose my 5'0 petite frame intimidated him. I asked the manager why my friends and I had been cut off, he replied by saying &quot; it is our policy to cut people off after a point.&quot; Confused, I said, well is one drink that point- because that is all we have had. He then proceeded to tell me, he will no longer serve us alcohol because one person in our party appeared drunk and he no longer wanted to serve us alcohol. I asked, so an entire group of people are cut off because of your perception of one person? He again repeated the standard lines above, &quot; it is our policy to cut people off after a point.&quot; At no point during our time at this restaurant was anyone in our party less than appropriate for the setting of the restaurant, and therefore the cause for the &quot;cut off&quot; was clearly motivated by something else. Our treatment was motivated by the fact that a group of young Black professionals were sitting in the restaurant laughing and interacting in a way that is outside of the white cultural norm of San Fransisco. Those interactions made the manager feel uncomfortable- and in a white hegemonic place like San Fransisco anything outside of white norms is decidedly not acceptable. We proceeded to pay our bill and leave the restaurant, it was clear, by the policing of our table and our behavior that we were not wanted. This Mexican restaurant that was being managed by a white man predominantly serving white people has created an atmosphere build on white norms and white comfortably and does not make room for norms outside of the status quo- and quite honestly has no problem dehumanizing and creating a frightening and uncomfortable atmosphere for people outside of their decided upon norms. This behavior is not unexpected, however, it is and will always be appalling.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

We were immediately given chips and salsa as well as water. The chips were pretty standard chips and there were three salsas: hot, verde, and spicy queso. The queso was too spicy for me to eat a lot of (I'm a medium spicy kind of person), so I stuck with the verde and hot and they were quite good. We ordered drinks and I had the Tropisueño margarita which was really tasty. I tried my friend's drink as well (don't remember what it was) and it was good. I'd love to come here for happy hour or something and try more of them. I ordered the barbacoa entree (Tampiqueño I believe) and it was very good and very filling. Probably a little too much for me but I ate it all anyway. It came with rice, your choice of beans (black, refried, or one other), a healthy portion of guacamole and an enchilada.

We had made the reservation about a week earlier for 8 of us at 6pm. We had training that day and realized we would actually be able to make it to dinner earlier. We tried calling the restaurant, but no one answered. We decided to try our luck and show up about 30 minutes early to see if they could seat us. The hostess was RUDE RUDE RUDE!! She was completely unwilling to help us and kept telling us how much they really couldn't accommodate 8 of us - umm, then why did you take the reservation? It was like she preferred if we left. When we were finally seated, the 8 of us were asked to cram into a booth that was really meant for four people with two chairs on the end. This is just unacceptable. Yes, the food was amazing and our server was actually great with us. If it wasn't for the way the dinner started, I would have no problem giving this place a four, or even a five. But when your hostess treats customers liked they're not at all valued, it makes for a crappy experience.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

(There's the Rotunda or MKT if you want a fancy -- and spendy -- lunch, but what about when you want to sit down with your family and would prefer not doing that at a food court slash human zoo?) Tropisueno is one of my favorite lunch options. (I can't vouch for it for dinner, but it has my lunch vote.) It is relatively relaxed and right near Yuerba Buena. They have solid Mexican food at lunch: tortas, burritos and combination plates. A plentiful salsa bar. This is not a hole in the wall but it is seat-yourself. Inside, they've created a harmonious atmosphere in their roomy dining room, complete with twinkle lights and carved wood furniture, despite the cafeteria style line-up. It's a relatively quick and easy lunch stop, providing a welcome respite from nearby crowds. The food is surprisingly hearty and good. The best orders are tortas and combo plates. They pass the good chip test: complimentary and taste deliciously handmade. Mole is a somewhat weaker link: saucy sweet versus packing good warm heat, but maybe still good for those who like a sweeter option.Careful at the salsa bar because some of the items marked as &quot;mild&quot; are anything but, and you'll find plentiful help-yourself sliced radishes, cilantro and fresh pico de gallo left out for the taking.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

You're starving. You are also in a group of about 15 people that are all having the same stomach growls. And then you walk into Tropisueno and your heart falls because the line is loooooong. But never fear! As everyone else mentioned, it moves really quickly! I stepped up and ordered a few chile rellenos, cause I'm a creature of habit, but noooooo! They were out! Trying to think quickly, I opted for the carnitas, and had a seat. The food came out super quick... and there was a huge plate of delicious and flavorful pork, and side plates with tortillas and fixings. The pork was missing a bit of the &quot;crunch&quot; I love, but that's ok... and the quac was pretty good as well! And just as quicly as we walked in, ordered, the food disappeared and we did as well. Given the size of the group (and we were loud), the fast moving line, the availability of a large table to seat us all, good food, during a crazy lunch hour... made me a fan.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

After a while in the booth, the temperature got extremely hot so I asked to sit at a community table. It cause a lot of problems and I felt bad about it.. But I'm pretty particular and I can't eat while sweating. It takes away from the eating experience! Anyway, the hostess told me next time I should stick with the spot.. I just didn't know it was going to be that hot. Our food came out shortly. I got the sausage with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes plate and my boyfriend got fried pork with potatoes and bacon! The sausage was really good! Very juicy and it went well with the mashed potatoes. The fried pork was good too! It was breaded and crunchy! Both meals went well with the beer. It was extremely filling! I was so full by the end of the night. When the bill came out, I asked who my tip would go to and it was transferred to the waiter who only helped us by saying &quot;do you need anything else?&quot; So I tipped the bartender, Craig, and the waitress separately since I had caused a problem for everyone. :/ but yeah. It was a nice restaurant and the food was delicious!

I am not going to lie, at first I thought wow it is loud in here and when the bartender pointed out that there were open seats available at a random party's table I thought oh dear. It is not what what had in mind but I am.so glad we stayed! So if you're expecting to have your own table this isn't the place for you. You might end up sitting with random people and you'll have to speak up because there is just so much going on in here. It seems like an excellent place to eat great German food or even grab some beers. Well, we ended up sitting by the bar and Craig was phenomenal with us. He has such great knowledge of beer and great attitude. He made our dining experience so much fun and introduced us to several great beers! My favorite was the Hefeweisen Dunkel. Craig truly made us feel welcomed. The food was pretty delicious too! I was a bit sad that they only serve chicken schnitzel on Sundays but our experience here made up for it. Their lentil soup was full of great flavor and so were the ravioli stuffed with pork and veggies on a mushroom sauce. Our experience exceeded our expectations and that is a plus on my book. The place is small and loud but robust! A solid establishment with a very personable and laid back attitude. Go check it out, and let Craig introduce you to some of his favorite beers. A quick note: Keep your eyes peeled when searching for this diamond because the sign is very small :-D</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

This place is for hard beer drinkers and big eaters (such people don't ask &quot;could you pack this to go?&quot;). The beers on tap are unique and refreshing, not the ones you get in-every-single-SF-&quot;pub&quot;. They are far apart from those losers: Heineken and the joke of a beer that they call Budweiser. These beers don't need fancy ads to be aired on prime-time, they sell themselves! The bar tenders, the waiters and the door receptionist set the ambience- they are fast, efficient and pleasant. After two pints you want to eat and eat you will because the food, it's delicious! The chef does a great job at preparing it to the right point. I had the chicken roast which had a stuffing and it was succulent, crispy and tasty. The sausages are delicious, needless to say because, well, they are authentic German. After having a ball of a meal, you'll sleep well, wake-up and would want to leave such a review.

Really flavorful and rich meals in a very cute environment. I ordered the Venison Medallions and my friend had ordered a special involving lamb, and both cuts were cooked to perfection and paired really well with the sides (that I at first thought sounded bland). It is a little on the pricey side, but the portions are generous (easily 2 meals unless you eat a lot) and they have a very impressive beer selection. The wait can get a little long but they do allow you to sit at the bar and drink while you wait for a table. I went on a Friday night once and was seated immediately, but a Tuesday night was a 40 minute wait for us, so it depends. They only do reservations for 6+ so might be worth it to get a group going. Really cute inside, but seating is communal tables that fit 6 (I think), so a little awkward if you're looking for an intimate date spot.

It's not everyone's cup of tea but it's delicious. 2. Pickled herring with sauerkraut, beets, carrots, cabbage, butter leaf lettuce, and a perfectly soft potato. The pickled herring was the perfect texture and the flavor wasn't too strong in any way. I would highly recommend this. 3. Roasted pork with sauerkraut and dumpling - To me, the dumpling was the STAR of this plate. I thought it would be just like a plain piece of dough to serve as a side, but it's more like round meatball with many spices and herbs. 4. Marinated and braised beef with lingonberries, red cabbage, and spätzle - Beef almost tasted like it was braised in wine (which it probably wasn't) but it had the same depth that is both hearty and comforting. The bartender helped us pick a drink based on a series of questions; I appreciated the effort. I loved the hustle and bustle of this place.

Everything was delicious, well presented and basically flavor explosions. From the outside it looked intimidating to because the doors looked like it was an entrance to a dungeon. But after going inside, you're greeted by a friendly gentleman and seated. The decor is light and airy, a bit whimsical with the in-flight birds on the ceiling. Very Pinterest-style. I got the meatloaf on the brunch menu. It was so good! The meatloaf is very different from the typical American one. The meat is cured and has a crunchy springy texture. Cross between the look and cut of spam to the texture like cured Vietnamese meat. It was so flavorful, and hearty. The roasted potatoes and the two sunny side eggs on top added additional protein for a substantial meal that calls for an afternoon nap. My girlfriend got the pork chop which is part of their regular menu. The entire pork chop was cured. So very different than what we are used to but it tasted amazing. The pork chop had texture like holiday ham in its hearty briny flavor that never ceases to be perfection. It sat on top of creamy mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, which gave the pork chop depth and richness. So yummy! Flavor combinations were spot on. I only wished we had room for the potato pancakes. I look forward to going back here again. The food was all delicious and I could tell the people who dine here really enjoy the food and beer and their culture. It was such a great experience to even get a glimpse of it. The food is comforting, atmosphere is nice during weekend mornings.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

The bartender, Sonny, gave us impeccable service and gave great recommendations for my beer and my girlfriend's wine. If you're anywhere near the area and enjoy large portions of delicious food, I couldn't recommend this place more.

Suppenküche has the best German food I've had so far, as well as an excellent beer selection. If you're feeling ambitious you can order your beer in the boot (a hefty 2 liter glass). Last I came here I had the wild boar sausage and it was delicious. Portions here are large so come hungry (and thirsty). The place can get pretty packed so expect a wait, but you can spend it at the bar with a cold beer so it's not so bad. I wouldn't recommend coming with a party larger than 4 unless you enjoy waiting</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

And then I moved to the East Bay and the schlepp to The City just became too much for a Schnitzel. As a friend just said: why should you leave the East Bay when you can eat at places like Speisekammer, Gaumenkitzel and Brotzeit? But I can tell you: Suppenküche is so worth it! Schlepp me there any time! I took the first bite from my huuuuge mixed salad and felt like home. Somewhere on the Bavarian countryside in the summer. Sitting in a beergarden under a chestnut tree. Holy beets, carrots and Kartoffelsalat! SO FREAKING GOOD! Then I took a bite of my Maultaschen and started to dream even more... The husband had the venison and loved it as well, but he is not as vocal as I am. And the beer! Oh holy Augustiner Edelstoff, glowing like you have a halo. I. Will. Be.

We came here on a Sunday night with a large party for a friend's birthday, and the place was a complete zoo. Maybe turning 32 has wore my nerves down but the entire restaurant was packed to the aisles. There are apparently 2 main rooms, separated by a narrow corridor that houses the 1 room bathrooms (no space to wait I guess). We had a reservation so I'm not sure how long it would have took to get seated if you just dropped by. The decor is cute with the weathered wood picnic tables and benches, and some communal seating. Noise really carries in this place -- I felt like I was having a screaming contest through the whole meal, so don't expect to come here and have a family dinner for conversation. The beer menu is pretty much the same as its outdoor rendition down the street -- I had the Radler (a light lager and lemon soda) and it was ok. We also had everything on the appetizer menu -- the food is not bad but I'm not overly impressed. Some items that stood out included the German ravioli in mushroom sauce, the potato pancakes with applesauce, and the currywurst. Other details: * Parking is ok in Hayes Valley -- one of the easier places to park in the city. * a lot of other venues and shopping in the area -- convenient location to a lot of fun stuff (like the park on Octavia st) * Price is a little high IMO but it IS the city and I'd assume everything here costs a little more than other parts of the peninsula.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

I love love the servers here. They are so personable and make sure you have a good experience. You feel like you are friends with them. Also the customers who come here usually have a good vibe and easy to make friends with at the community tables. This place can seat a lot of people, I barely had to wait each time. Longest I had to wait might be around 20mins, that was only once. I think if you come right when they open or little before, you might get a seat. Coming with a group bigger than 4 or 5 is not really recommended. It can be really busy and hectic, and might be hard to get your server's attention. Food: The food here is pretty good and generously portioned. My favorites are the Breaded and Sautéed Pork loin with potatoes and Sauteed Pork loin with mushroom sauce. Ultimate comfort food! Beer selection: Excellent. If you don't know what to get, ask for suggestions from your server. Also get the big boot, but they only give you one per table. Just pass it around and share the goodness, if you can't finish by yourself. Parking: Street parking can be tricky, but it is manageable. On average you might spend 5-10mins trying to find parking. Good luck! Overall: Definitely recommended. I will be frequenting this place.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

I have no idea why Trop is so good but it is! The service, the food, the prices.. all on point (on point = well executed). Lunchtime = cantina style! Cantina style is mexican for going up and ordering at the counter similar to cafateria style. Note that burritos are only served during lunchtime (even though it's one of Trop's best items). I suggest the Mojado Burrito (~$10) if you like it wet and flavorful. Service: Everyone's no nonsense which I like (?). For dinner, the waitress told me to go drink at the bar to wait for my party. The bartender told me to update my ID picture. When the rest of my party came, the waitress told me to close out my bar tab and bring my beer to the table (Modelo Negro was ~$4 during HH btw). From this experience, I learned I'm really, really good at following directions. More importantly, I didn't really have to think about anything other than what I wanted to eat. Food: Everyone talks about the food so I'm not going to bore anyone with the details. Definitely order the guac and hit the Mole if you're into that. Everything on the menu is solid. I. mean. everything. FYI - the cheese tamale isn't vegetarian because they add secret goodness into the maize. ;) Location: Yerba Buena, Westfield Mall, Metreon, tourist stuff, etc. Needless to say it's an awesome location that's easily accessible by bike, BART, MUNI, pretty much anything.. Keep in mind the restaurant is located in between the Powell and Montgomery street stations. Other suggestions: This would be a cool first date place on a weekday, if you're into that. Good food, full bar, loud enough of a restaurant so there's never really an awkward silence and tons of options in the area to hit up. Tropisueno is highly raved and for good reason. It's definitely a must-try.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

It first started when both hostesses were extremely rude to me when I wanted to change tables in a half EMPTY restaurant. I had made a reservation, so there was no reason why I had to be in the back of the place when all the window seats where I wanted to be were empty. I came right before rush hour just to avoid all this and get a good seat, did not work. The place was packed within 15 minutes and other people got the seats I wanted. Lazy hostesses need to get off their high horse and do their job. Don't let the high number of reviews fool you, they are mostly from the workers in the surrounding area who just come here to eat after work and go. So they don't really care if the experience is good or not. My party got our meals after 1 hour of waiting. The surrounding tables who came after us got their meals and had left before we even finished. Not only that, they have a policy during dinners you can only stay 1.5 hours because the place is busy. I had to tell my waiter that I did not want to be kicked out before I finished my food. The waiter did not care that my table was waiting an hour for food, no updates even after asking twice. No sincere apologies or anything to make our time there better. They just kept on insisting we buy extra drinks to pass the time. I did not pester them and was as kind as possible, and I still get treated like trash from everyone who works there. Food is not nearly good enough to charge $15-20 per plate and $10-15 drinks.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

I ordered a margarita (The House one) and it was delicious. I then ordered a cheese tamale and two vegetable enchiladas. Initially they were amazing, but the problem was they heated them to a point where they were perfect when they came out but quickly cooled. By the time I ate the tamale it was about room temperature. Wished it was heated a little bit more. That being said the food tasted great and I plan on returning next time I am in the area. I would recommend making a reservation as well because there is not a great place to wait (outside is cold at dinner time) and sometimes the wait can be a little longer (~30 minutes)</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

This place is delicious!! Food was fresh and tasted very authentic! I love Mexican food and I will have to say, this place is probably my favorite! We ordered 2 super tacos with carne asada with rice and beans, a tamale, shrimp burrito, and chips and guacamole (there is a VERY YUMMY salsa bar with plenty of choices). The meat was flavorful and the portions were great! I'm a taco fanatic and I ordered 2 tacos and I was full after the first! The burrito was also a huge portion so we ended up taking the tamale home (we had it for breakfast....soo delicious!) The chips are refillable and the drinks are tasty as well. I ordered a modelo negra chavela...had to be one of the most refreshing chavelas I've had! My boyfriend had a strawberry margarita and the strawberry purée is fresh and made in house! Overall great place. I love the location and the ambiance of the restaurant. I cannot wait to come back! Yum!!</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

Tropisueno is a swanky, dimly lit, and lively Mexican restaurant with a wide menu of fun (read: strong) tequila-based drinks and bold flavors. Everything from tamales (my personal favorite) to enchiladas to crudos. I like getting the los favoritos (favorites) old school combo plates so I can try a &quot;little&quot; of everything. I've been here a few times and have never left disappointed (just really really full). They also have an awesome happy hour from 4-6pm weekdays. Enjoy!</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

Very quickly made to order in front of you, the bar has a nice selection of drinks and the salsa is probably the highlight of the entire restaurant but I am not sure I would call this a favorite of mine by any means. The food was good, not so much authentic but good enough for a quick meal if you're in the area and have a craving for some mexican food. It was fresh and the staff were friendly. I would return but it's not on the top of my list of places to eat in the city.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>
                <div class="rest_review_box"><div class="rest_review_info col-md-12" style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px;">Reviewed on 7/14/2015 10:10 AM<div class="full_review_text"><p>Tropisueno had been on my list for a long time, but every time I looked at pictures it seemed a little meh and I expected Chevy's-esque food. I'd learned my lesson with upscale Mexican food at Nopalito i.e. the most $$$ and smallest portions I've ever encountered for Mexican food. Tropisueno was finally put on the calendar when I was summoned to pick a dinner place around Powell, and when I realized they have normal-people portions instead of tapas, which is a euphemism for the fastest way to unknowingly go broke. Anyways, enough of Nopalito bashing. Here is my take on Tropisueno: (+/-) Chips and salsa, complimentary: Not particularly outstanding, and the chips aren't warm. Quite possibly bought in bulk from a wholesaler. The salsa is alright and the orange one is interestingly spicy, but otherwise it's average. (+) Rice and beans, complimentary: Choice of pinto, black, and white Peruvian. White beans! What a nice change from the age-old question of pinto or black. (++) Chile Verde, $14 (tender pieces of pork simmered in tangy tomatillos, green peppers, chiles and herbs. house favorite): Pork is so tender, it's like pork belly minus the fat. The seasoning is intense and complex: piquant, earthy, aromatic. (++) Enchiladas de Nopales, $14 (grilled chicken or veggies, corn, cactus and chiles in a fresh corn cream sauce): Hearty and creative take on enchiladas (cactus!!) (+) Margarita, $10: Much better than your average margarita at a random bar. (+) Margarita with violet liquor, $10: Personally I couldn't really taste the violet liquor, and I found it funny that it looked exactly like the regular margarita, except in a old fashioned glass rather than a Collins. Portions are huge and could last two meals. (Secret: I got a box for leftovers, but it was so tasty that I ended up finishing it while waiting for a movie at the Metreon) The ambiance is upscale and nice--a theme of polished wood and dim lighting with an elegant storefront. They pay attention to details, like the wispy curtains in the windows and pebble-lined candles. Takes reservations with the easy online Yelp system, so we got a table at 7pm on a Saturday with no wait. One of those win moments when I felt like a savvy SF local :3</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>

At lunch it is cafeteria style; line up, order, pay, then sit. It was pretty busy, but the line moved fast. There were lots of options for a vegetarian like myself. I ordered the combo plate with black bean and the tofu rojo. It also came with 4 corn tortilla. My friend had steak quesadillas and he said they were very good. Definitely some good Mexican food and I will be back to try some of the other stuff on the menu.

Best tasting quesadilla I've ever had. The tortilla was the most flavorful thing ever. Not sure what they use or do, probably tons of butter, but amen brother. Meat was bomb too, not cheap junk meat. Cool place, great for locals and tourists, as it is hidden, but in perfect location if you have a conference at the Marquis. Drinks are stiff. Lines are long, seating is tough, so be prepared.</p></div><br/><div class="review_quicklinks"><ul class="floatRight"><li><a href="#">Useful</a></li><li><a href="#">Share</a></li></ul></div></div></div>
